## Introduction
This is the Official release page for the LMNO GuildPack!
Here you'll find the current release, old versions, the mod list and all that you need to know to get started and play with us!
The Idea started out as a small suggestion but quickly exploded, and now we even have a Git Page! Yay~
This will be the page to refer to for updates and everything

## ChangeLog:
>Here you'll see the current changes from the last version of the mod pack!

```
Version 1.3
Stable, ModLoader version: Forge-14.23.2.2611


Added: No new mods were added
Removed: DecoCraft, and its dependency PTRLib, were removed due to excessive stress, causing the game to fail world generation.

```

## Instructions:
### * Modpack Installation:
1. Let's start by getting the [download](https://github.com/Lyndies/LMNO-GuildPack#downloads) going. 
1. Now that we have the .zip file, we'll need to go on the twitch app, on the Minecraft Mod Tab.
1. We'll then create a "Custom Profile".
1. Under "Create Profile", there'll be a little "Import" link. Click on it.
1. Now you'll just need to browse to where you saved your .zip file and select it!

Done! Now Twitch will automatically proceed to download everything that's needed for you to play, and you're ready to go!

### * Allocating More RAM
1. Start by going on the Minecraft Mod Tab, in the Twitch app.
1. Once there, just right click on the Modpack you want to allocate more RAM to.
1. Click on "View Profile".
1. Click on the 3 dots in the upper right corner.
1. Go to "Profile Options".
1. Uncheck the "Use System Settings", under "Memory Options"
1. Move the slider in order to allocate as much RAM as wanted!

Here you go! Now the game will automatically start with as much RAM as you instructed it too.
If you're having FPS lag, or the Modpack runs slowly, give the pack a bit more allocated RAM to make it run smoother!
