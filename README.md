## Introduction
This is the Official release page for the LMNO GuildPack!
Here you'll find the current release, old versions, the mod list and all that you need to know to get started and play with us!
The Idea started out as a small suggestion but quickly exploded, and now we even have a Git Page! Yay~
This will be the page to refer to for updates and everything

## ChangeLog:
>Here you'll see the current changes from the last version of the mod pack!

```
Version 1.3
Stable, ModLoader version: Forge-14.23.2.2611


Added: No new mods were added
Removed: DecoCraft, and its dependency PTRLib, were removed due to excessive stress, causing the game to fail world generation.
